            <h2>Why BlogHaven?</h2>
            <p>
                BlogHaven was built as a full-stack Django project with
                a focus on modern UI, accessibility, and real-world
                development practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                It serves both as a functional blogging platform and
                as a learning project that demonstrates clean architecture,
                user authentication, and interactive features.
